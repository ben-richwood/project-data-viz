## FE Framework (2)

Lit
https://lit.dev/
Lit is a simple library for building fast, lightweight web components. At Lit's core is a boilerplate-killing component base class that provides reactive state, scoped styles, and a declarative template system that's tiny, fast and expressive. Building on top of the Web Components standards, Lit adds just what you need to be happy and productive: reactivity, declarative templates and a handful of thoughtful features to reduce boilerplate and make your job easier. Every Lit feature is carefully designed with web platform evolution in mind.

Marko
https://markojs.com/
A declarative, HTML-based language that makes building web apps fun. Marko is HTML re-imagined as a language for building dynamic and reactive user interfaces. Just about any valid HTML is valid Marko, but Marko extends the HTML language to allow building modern applications in a declarative way.

SolidJS
https://www.solidjs.com/
Simple and performant reactivity for building user interfaces. Consistently tops recognized UI speed and memory utilization benchmarks.

Ionic
https://ionicframework.com/
Cross-platform apps. Powered by the Web. Free and open source, Ionic offers a library of mobile-optimized UI components, gestures, and tools for building fast, highly interactive apps.


Capacitor
https://capacitorjs.com/
A cross-platform native runtime for web apps. Capacitor is an open source native runtime for building Web Native apps. Create cross-platform iOS, Android, and Progressive Web Apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Astro
https://astro.build/
Build faster websites with less client-side Javascript. For a technology built on top of three different languages, the modern web seems to focus an awful lot on JavaScript. We don’t think it has to—and that’s certainly not a revolutionary concept. While we’re at it, it’s time to accept that the framework wars won’t have a winner—that’s why Astro lets you use any framework you want (or none at all). And if most sites only have islands of interactivity, shouldn’t our tools optimize for that? We’re not the first to ask the question, but we might be the first with an answer for every framework.

Dear ImGUI
https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies). Dear ImGui is designed to enable fast iterations and to empower programmers to create content creation tools and visualization / debug tools (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal, and lacks certain features normally found in more high-level libraries.
